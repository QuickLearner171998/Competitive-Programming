"""Q.2
Given a sum of elements (n) and a number of elements (k), find the number of distinct arrays under these conditions:

In each array, the there are k elements whose sum is equal to n.
In each array, each element should be greater than or equal to the element on its left.
The elements formed in each array are distinct

Note: elements have to be positive integers
Example:
n = 8 k = 4
Answer: 5
Explanation: [1,1,1,5], [1,1,2,4], [1,1,3,3], [1,2,2,3], [2,2,2,2]
Each array has 4 (k) elements a sum of 8 (n) with each element on the left <= element on the right.
There are 5 possible distinct solutions."""
